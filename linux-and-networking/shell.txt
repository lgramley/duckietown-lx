1. cat seems like it's hanging because it is reading data from a file. However, without 
a file give, it reads from standard input. It is attempting to interact with the user by just
repeating the input back. 

2. cat exits when ctrl-D is hit. If ctrl-d is hit after typting something in (without hitting enter before ctrl-d), then
it will send whatever was typed to stdin (input stream) and write it back to stdout(output stream) before exiting. 
The main purpose of this is to read data from the input file or input text and output it to stdout.

Pipes:
1. echo "1" > one.txt
   echo "2" > two.txt
   echo "3" > three.txt

2. ls |sort -r

3. cat | echo "hello world"

4. echo hello world

Standard Error:

1. sorted.txt contains all of the files in the directory and their permissions which is just the regular output. 
standard error would contain all of the error messages associated with the command or the errors that happen while the program is running.
The redirect symbol only redirects standard output not standard error.
