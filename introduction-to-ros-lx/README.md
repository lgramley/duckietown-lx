# **Learning Experience (LX): Introduction to ROS**

# About these activities

In this learning experience you will learn what ROS is, why it is useful in robotics and how to use it.

This learning experience is provided by the Duckietown team and can be run on Duckiebots. Visit us at the 
[Duckietown Website](https://www.duckietown.com) for more learning materials, documentation, and demos.

# Instructions

**NOTE:** All commands below are intended to be executed from the root directory of this exercise (i.e., the directory containing this README).


## 1. Make sure your exercise is up-to-date

Update your exercise definition and instructions,

    git pull upstream duckiedrone-lxs

**NOTE:** Example instructions to fork a repository and configure to pull from upstream can be found in the [duckietown-lx repository README](https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-lx/blob/mooc2022/README.md).


## 2. Make sure your system is up-to-date

- 💻 Always make sure your Duckietown Shell is updated to the latest version. See [installation instructions](https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-shell)

- 💻 Update the shell commands: `dts update`

- 💻 Update your laptop/desktop: `dts desktop update`


## 3. Work on the exercise

### Launch the code editor

Open the code editor by running the following command,

```
dts code editor
```

Wait for a URL to appear on the terminal, then click on it or copy-paste it in the address bar
of your browser to access the code editor. The first thing you will see in the code editor is
this same document, you can continue there.


### Walkthrough of notebooks

**NOTE**: You should be reading this from inside the code editor in your browser.

Inside the code editor, use the navigator sidebar on the left-hand side to navigate to the
`notebooks` directory and open the first notebook.

Follow the instructions on the notebook and work through the notebooks in sequence.


## Handin

Use this github classroom link to make a github repository for this assignment. Push the files that you need to hand in to this repository. https://classroom.github.com/a/K6YAGyXq
You should hand in all the files you create including the ROS package.

### ℹ️️ Check Robot Compatibility

While we try our best to support running these exercises on all versions of the Duckiebot, some activities require special hardware and
are only supported on specific robots. Please use this section to ensure the compatibility of the exercise and your
robot.

The support matrix of this exercise is as follows:

| Duckiebot Type   	                                                                                | Configuration 	 | Support Level   	    |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| [DB21-J4](https://get.duckietown.com/products/duckiebot-db21?variant=41543707099311)            	 | Jetson 4GB    	 | ✔️ Full Support    	 |
| [DB21-J2](https://get.duckietown.com/products/duckiebot-db21?variant=40700056830127)            	 | Jetson 2GB    	 | ✔️ Full Support 	    |


### 🚙 Testing on a physical robot

You can test your agent on the robot using the command,

    dts code workbench --duckiebot YOUR_DUCKIEBOT

This is the modality "everything runs on the robot".

You can also test using

    dts code workbench --duckiebot YOUR_DUCKIEBOT --local 

This is the modality "drivers running on the robot, agent runs on the laptop."


### 📽 Perform local evaluation

We suggest you evaluate your work locally before submitting your solution.
You can do so by running the following command,

    dts code evaluate

This should take a few minutes.
This is not supposed to be an interactive process: just let it run, and when you return,
you will find the output in a folder, including videos, and trajectories, and all the statistics
you would usually find on the website.


### 📬 Submit your solution

When you are ready to submit your homework, use the following command,

    dts code submit

This will package all your code and send it to the Duckietown servers for evaluation.

## Troubleshooting


If an error of this form occurs

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/duckietown_challenges_cli/cli.py", line 76, in dt_challenges_cli_main
    dt_challenges_cli_main_(args=args, sections=sections, main_cmd="challenges")

you need to log into docker using `dts`. Use this command:

```
dts challenges config --docker-username <USERNAME> --docker-password <PASSWORD>
